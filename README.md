# -Automatic-Step-Light-Using-Sensors-
This project is a smart step-lighting system that automatically turns on lights when it detects human movement. It uses a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor to sense motion near the steps and an Arduino to control the lighting. When someone walks near the sensor, the lights turn on for safe and convenient movement in dark areas. After a short delay, the lights turn off automatically, helping save energy. This system is ideal for staircases, hallways, and nighttime use in smart homes
